=head1 NAME

Async::Methods - Namespaced sugar methods for async/await and future/promise based code

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Mojo::UserAgent;
  
  my $ua = Mojo::UserAgent->new;
  
  # Normal synchronous code
  
  print $ua->get('http://trout.me.uk/')->result->body;
  
  # Equivalent code running synchronously atop promises
  
  print $ua->get_p('http://trout.me.uk')->then::result->await::body;
  
  # Equivalent code within an async subroutine
  
  use Mojo::Base -async_await, -signatures;
  
  async sub fetch ($url) {
    await $ua->get_p($url)->then::result->then::body;
  }
  
  print fetch($url)->await::this;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Async::Methods> provides a set of helper methods operating via namespace
that make chaining together asynchronous methods easier. This is not at all
meant to be a replacement for the C<async> and C<await> keywords available
via L<Future::AsyncAwait> or the C<-async_await> flag to L<Mojo::Base> and
in fact is largely meant to be used I<with> such facilities.

Note that in the following code I use C<$p> for example variables but they
can be L<Future> or L<Mojo::Promise> objects or (hopefully) objects of any
other class that provides a similar interface.

Note that methods of each type provided can be called three ways:

  $obj->the_type::some_method(@args);

will call C<some_method> on a relevant object, and is effectively simply
sugar for the second type,

  $obj->the_type::_(some_method => @args);

which calls the method name given in its first argument (yes, this means that
you can't use the first syntax to call a method called C<_> but the author of
this module strongly suspects that won't be an inconvience in most cases).

Thirdly, to match perl's capacity to allow <$obj->$cb(@args)> as a syntax, you
can also call:

  $obj->the_type::_(sub { ... } => @args);
  $obj->the_type::_($cb => @args);

to call that code reference as a method.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 start::

  my $p = $obj->start::some_method(@args);
  my $p = $obj->start::_(some_method => @args);
  my $p = $obj->start::_(sub { ... } => @args);

L</start::> methods don't do anything special in and of themselves but
register the C<$obj> with L<Async::Methods> to allow L</catch::> and
L</else::> to work correctly (see their documentation below for why you
might find that useful). Other than the registration part, this is
entirely equivalent to

  my $p = $obj->some_method(@args);

=head2 then::

  my $then_p = $p->then::some_method(@args);
  my $then_p = $p->then::_(some_method => @args);
  my $then_p = $p->then::_(sub { ... } => @args);

L</then::> allows for chaining an additional method call from the return
value of the previous promise (assuming it's successful). As such, on its own
this is equivalent to

  my $then_p = $p->then(
    sub ($obj, @rest) { $obj->some_method(@args, @rest)) }
  );

Note that L</then::> does not require anything special of the promise upon
which it's called to provide the base functionality, but I<does> need to be
called on the result of something rooted in L</start::> if you want to be
able to chain L</else::> or L</catch::> from the return value.

=head2 else::

  my $else_p = $p->else::some_method(@args);
  my $else_p = $p->else::_(some_method => @args);
  my $else_p = $p->else::_(sub { ... } => @args);


L</else::> must be called on the result of a L</start::> chained to a
L</then::>, and provides a callback if the L<start::>ed method fails,
invoked on the I<original> invocant. This makes it the "other half" of
L<Async::Methods>' support for two-arg C<<->then>>, so:

  my $else_p = $obj->start::one(@args1)
                   ->then::two(@args2)
                   ->else::three(@args3);

is functionally equivalent to:

  my $else_p = $obj->one(@args1)
                   ->then(
                       sub ($then_obj, @then_rest) {
                         $then_obj->two(@args2, @then_rest)
                       },
                       sub (@error) {
                         $obj->three(@args3, @error)
                       },
                     );

which the author hopes explains why you might, on the whole, not really
mind being forced to type L<start::>.

Note that because L</else::> always resolves to the second argument to a
two-arg C<then> call, it can't be used in isolation. Fortunately, we already
provide L</catch::> for that, which is documented next.

=head2 catch::

  my $catch_p = $p->catch::some_method(@args);
  my $catch_p = $p->catch::_(some_method => @args);
  my $catch_p = $p->catch::_(sub { ... } => @args);

L</catch::> can be called on the result of either a L</start::> call or 
a L</start::> -> L</then::> chain, and will catch any/all errors produced
up to this point, as opposed to L</else::> which catches errors I<before>
the preceding L</then::> call.

As such, morally equivalent to:

  my $catch_p = $obj->start::whatever(...)
                    ->catch(sub ($obj, @error) {
                        $obj->some_method(@args, @error)
                      });

=head2 await::

  my $ret = $p->await::this;

C<await::this> is simple generic sugar for (at top level of your code outside
of an already-running event loop) spinning the event loop until the promise
completes and then either returning the result on success or C<die()>ing with
the error on failure. For a future, it's equivalent to

  my $ret = $f->get;

but if called on a L<Mojo::Promise> loads L<Mojo::Promise::Role::Get> and uses
that to complete the operation, so C<await::this> can be called on either and
still provides a uniform interface. Assuming you install
L<Mojo::Promise::Role::Get> if you need it of course - otherwise you'll get
an exception from the relevant C<require> call.

  my $ret = $p->await::some_method(@args);
  my $ret = $p->await::_(some_method => @args);
  my $ret = $p->await::_(sub { ... } => @args);

L</await::> requires absolutely nothing of the promise upon which it's called,
and other than the special case of C<this> is equivalent to

  my $ret = $p->then::some_method(@args)->await::this;

Hopefully obvious caveat: If you want to await a method called C<this> you'll
need to call one of

  my $ret = $p->then::this(@args)->await::this;
  my $ret = $p->await::_(this => @args);

but C<this> did not strike the author as a sufficiently common method name
to be a deal-breaker in practice.
